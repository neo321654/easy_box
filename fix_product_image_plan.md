# Plan to Fix Product Image Loading Issue

## 1. Goal

The goal is to identify and fix the issue of product images not loading in the inventory list and to create an automated test to verify the fix and prevent future regressions.

## 2. Test-Driven Approach

We will follow a test-driven development (TDD) approach:
1.  **Write a Failing Test:** Create an E2E test that reproduces the bug.
2.  **Fix the Code:** Implement the necessary code changes to make the test pass.
3.  **Verify the Fix:** Run the test again to ensure it passes.

## 3. Plan

### Step 1: Create a Failing E2E Test
- I will add a new test case to `test_driver/app_test.dart`.
- This test will:
  - Log in to the app.
  - Navigate to the inventory page.
  - Find a product in the list that is known to have an image.
  - Check for the visibility of the `ProductImage` widget and verify that it's not just showing a placeholder.

### Step 2: Debug the Image Loading Logic
- I will review the following files:
  - `lib/features/inventory/presentation/widgets/product_list_item.dart`: To see how the `ProductImage` widget is used.
  - `lib/features/inventory/presentation/widgets/product_image.dart`: To analyze the image loading logic, including URL handling and the `CachedNetworkImage` implementation.
  - `lib/features/inventory/data/models/product_model.dart`: To check how image URLs are parsed from the JSON response.
  - `lib/features/inventory/data/datasources/inventory_remote_data_source_api_impl.dart`: To see how the image URL is fetched from the backend.

### Step 3: Implement the Fix
- Based on the debugging, I will implement the necessary code changes. This might involve correcting URL parsing, fixing widget logic, or addressing data model issues.

### Step 4: Run the Test and Verify
- I will run the E2E test suite again.
- The goal is to have the new test case pass, along with all existing tests.

### Step 5: Clean Up
- After the fix is confirmed, I will ask for your preference on committing the changes and whether to keep the new test case as part of the permanent test suite.
